Tabernae, the precursors to taverns, would hang vine leaves outside where wine was sold. But during the Roman invasion, hard-to-find vine leaves were swapped for bushes, giving rise to names like The Bush Inn or The Bull & Bush."},{"type":"text","value":"This tradition of naming pubs after what was hung above their doors continued into the Middle Ages where watering holes and inns would display distinct objects like ploughs or kettles to attract patrons. Because most of the population was illiterate at the time, these hanging objects and pictorial signs marked pubs with names like The Wheatsheaf and The Plough Inn."}],"methods":[{"type":"text","value":"Over 41,000 currently open pubs <a href=https://github.com/the-pudding/pubs-data target=_blank rel=noopener>were collected</a> from <a href=https://www.pubsgalore.co.uk/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Pubs Galore</a>, where members maintain the largest list of pubs in the United Kingdom (England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland). We focused on four common naming patterns and filtered the pubs into “color + noun”, “royalty + noun”, “noun + inn/hotel” and “noun & noun” groups. Then, we counted up pubs with the same name (i.e. there are 352 pubs named “Red Lion” and 258 pubs named “Royal Oak”), giving us around 200 unique names within our patterns."},{"type":"text","value":"To calculate the shortest pub crawl between pubs with the same name, we used <a href=https://docs.mapbox.com/api/navigation/#optimization target=_blank rel=noopener>Mapbox’s Optimization API</a>, which returns a “duration-optimized route between the input coordinates.” The API works to solve the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem target=_blank rel=noopener>Traveling Salesperson Problem</a> (TSP), or the question: “Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?” The Optimization API returned the pub stops coordinates in the order in which we needed to visit them for the shortest route. We then used <a href=https://docs.mapbox.com/help/glossary/directions-api/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Mapbox’s Direction API</a> to plot that route between pubs. Finally, we used <a href=https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/ target=_blank rel=noopener>Mapbox GL JS</a> to display the routes on the above map.
